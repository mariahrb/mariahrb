# Hey there! 👋

I'm Mariah, a software developer & student who loves integrating ideas and designing quirky solutions.  
I thrive on minimalism, but I don't mind a dash of fun.

- 💻 I build things for the web, and sometimes break them (for science).
- 🧠 Student by day, developer by night (and sometimes both).
- 🎨 Minimalist at heart, but my code occasionally wears funny hats.
- 📚 I love reading—it's like debugging reality.
